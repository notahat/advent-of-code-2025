# Pete's Advent of Code 2025 Solutions

* I'm using Ruby, coz it's good at this sort of thing.
* I'm trying to keep the code simple and understandable:
  * Small functions, sensible naming, comments.
  * A lot of idiomatic Ruby use of enumerable methods, even when it's not very
    efficient.
  * No error handling to speak of. I assume the input is well-formed.
